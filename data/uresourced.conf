# MemoryLow allocation of

[ActiveUser]
# This creates a memory allocation for the active user.

[SessionSlice]
# The following values default to the ones from ActiveUser. By default, this
# creates a session.slice drop-in configuration with the exact same settings
# as ActiveUser has.
# i.e. delegate all the memory to session critical applications and boost them
# in the same relation as an active user is boosted compared to inactive ones.
